## UX

Visitors who are not logged in are welcomed to the site and encouraged to register, allowing them to access more
content on the site, such as the products available.

The visitors can access the **Login** and the **About** Page through the navigation bar at the top, this will let users
Login if they already have an account. 

The about page will give you information that you might be looking for, and once again encouraging registration.

They can also access **Sign Up** that is displayed at the center of the main page, this will redirect to the **Register** page.
